Website Rundown:
    This is a website designed primarily around the creation and sharing of fun online quizzes. Sprouting from
    the age old question, "Which type of bread am I?", I decided to create my own space for making these quizzes.
    Eventually I plan to focus the website around the social aspect of taking online quizzes. This means I want to 
    have profiles and upvotes and my hope is to generate some semblence of a community for the users. One of the 
    biggest quirks of the site is that your first result upon taking any specific quiz is recorded and shown to anyone
    viewing your account. This keeps you accountable, for example, say you get Rye bread as your first result for a quiz,
    but you really want your friends to think you are Sourdough. You keep taking the quiz until you get the result you 
    want and then you screenshot it and show everyone. Well on my website, the first result is forever stored and showed
    off on your profile, so anyone wishing to fact check you need simply to check your account for themselves.
